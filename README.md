Quality control on the personal-identification-pipeline created by Zaaijer et al. using minION sequenced HeLa CaSki cell lines.

Zaaijer et al. build a pipeline personal-identification-pipeline to quickly determine cancer types in cell lines. This pipeline implements the minION sketching method which identifies cell lines based on the present SNP's present in short, raw minION reads. The paper about this study is stated below:

To control this the personal-identification-pipeline, a pipeline was build, using minION sequenced HeLa CaSki cell lines as data.
The flow chart of all programs and steps of this pipeline is depicted below.
